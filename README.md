# CodersCoin Seed Node list
This is a repository where you can upload the IP/hostname and port of your node, so wallets or other node runners can set you as their seed node!

The network could operate using only one or two nodes as a seed node. Any node can be a seed node, their job is to introduce new peers to the network, thus enabling decentralized peer discovery.
